# STRÃ˜M International
Technical puncture for a website for our company, based on JAMstack and SSG 11ty that sits on github and automatically builds via Netlify.

## Important
- This repo is connected to netlify and automatically deploys on https://strom.international on merge of a pull request.
- Once you push a branch, you can create an according pull request on github from the branch commit.
- Pull requests have an automatic netlify deploy preview under a hashed URL per commit that you can look at from the pull request.
  - Once you created the pull request, even if kept open, each push will get it's own deploy preview on push.
- Lighthouse audit on pull request (https://github.com/jakejarvis/lighthouse-action)
- Everything described below is currently implemented on the branch "skeleton" that is deployed to https://skeleton.strom.international
